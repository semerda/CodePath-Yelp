# Project 2 - *Kraken Yelp*

**Kraken Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **âˆž** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Filter page
   - [x] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
   - [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Using Custom Fonts - OpenSans.
- [x] Added Navigate using Maps from Restaurant Detail view.
- [x] When image fails, loads the Kraken Failed placeholder image.
- [x] Added MBProgressHUD for API calls.
- [x] Added Infinity Scroll.
- [x] Used [DZNEmptyDataSet](https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet) - for showing empty datasets whenever the view has no content to display.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Filters view and expanding sections.
2. Location Services - when to call, best practises for avoiding battery drain while maintaining good location coordinates.
